Existing solutions for low precision inference work well for small batch sizes, but suffer from following issues: Performance drops when we increase the batch size Restrictions on types of quantization, for example, some kernels only support symmetric quantization that could have implications on accuracy of the model at lower bits Interplay between quantization, serialization, and tensor parallelism (TP) makes it difficult to load quantized models and requires changes to user models To address these challenges, we created an end-to-end, performant, modular and extensible low-precision inference solution integrating the following libraries: GemLite , a Triton kernel library, tackles the performance limitations of large batch sizes and restrictions on the types of quantization TorchAO , a PyTorch-native library, provides a streamlined experience for quantization, sparsity, and tensor parallelism (with DTensor) SGLang , a fast, efficient and hackable serving framework for Large Language Model (LLM) and Vision Language Models (VLM) with extensive model support If you’re interested in trying this out in SGLang, please follow these repro instructions
